It was there where she acquired the zen-like patience to handle difficult customers and the ability to multitask in the busiest of times.

She's your new best friend. </p>

                    <p>Jack is a new media maven having worn multiple startup hats since graduating from Boston College. He became a fanatic of 'all things web' after profiting from his first eBay sale at age 10 (a set of GI Joe Pogs). Most recently, Jack crafted online display advertising strategies for brands at AdRoll.com. Before that, Jack wielded the mighty PR pen along with managing viral promotions at Swap.com, a peer-to-peer exchange for entertainment media. At North Social, Jack helps power various brand marketing initiatives, assists with content creation, and raises the mean height in the office by over two inches (yep, he's 6-6). Offline, you'll find him hanging from a rock or at the local point break hanging ten. </p>

Before assisting our growing user base with handy app tips and tricks, she was busy being sporty; striking the ball for the University of Southern California's 2007 NCAA Women's Soccer National Champs. A force off the field as well, Shannon crossed the academic finish line early with cum laude honors. She then lent out her organizational superpowers in the 2010 US Senate Campaign, keeping the collective eye on the prize by marshaling an army of volunteers. Shannon maintains her athletic prowess with marathon kickboxing and Zumba sessions, but equally relishes being between the pages of a European travel guide planning her next trip.</p>

Lauren attended UC Berkeley where she built a solid foundation in art history. She then went on to drop knowledge lecturing about the Gold Rush at the Oakland Museum of California. Now, whenever the North Social office goes panning for gold (ummm, valuable app tips), we follow Lauren's lead. Don't be surprised to hear of Lauren's Partridge-family childhood either (she played bass guitar in a family band with her brothers). When she's not chalking up a timeline of improved customer satisfaction, Lauren spends time cooking with Elspeth and making canine lovers jealous at the local park with her dog Boo. </p>

                    <h2>Ashley McManama</h2>
                    <h3>User Education &amp; Social Experience</h3>
                    <p>Ashley joined the North Social team after a career in the teaching world. Born and raised in Massachusetts, she attended Boston College, and later traversed across our grand nation to settle in San Francisco. She brings her powers of communication and enduring patience to the world of customer experience at North Social, where she's eager to untangle interweb woes and customer conundrums. She entertains the team with her quick and random word-song association skills in which she can seamlessly instill annoying songs into the heads of those who surround her. Once a swimmer, lax player, and soccer aficionado, Ashley has since transformed herself into a gymrat, city biker and an outdoor enthusiast. Watch out, folks. </p>

                    <p>Kealy is a recent UC Berkeley graduate with a degree in Sociology bringing fantastic customer experience to the team! She is always here to help out our awesome clientele with all their inquiries. Kealy is also becoming a social media queen on North Social's Facebook, Twitter, and Support Forum. Outside of our OakTown offices she can usually be found on a pool deck coaching women's water polo for USA water polo (psst...she played for CAL), Diablo Club, and Monte Vista High School! She has recently become a Bar Method enthusiast and credits her newfound stamina and energy for solving any social media-related crisis we throw her way.</p>

                    <h2>Chris Volz</h2>
                    <h3>Custom Application Development</h3>
                    <p>Chris is the developer behind many of our secret spices and sauces at North Social (ahem, custom Facebook apps).  We're not quite sure how many languages he's fluent in (PHP. Python, Ruby, and Java to name a few), but he has used that large vocabulary to help our team create some of the most heavily used and shared applications on Facebook. Chris would like you to know that he became interested in the web, long before cute videos of kittens became viral sensations. Prior to bringing his online talents to North Social, Chris was developing intuitive technology solutions for innovative brands like Linden Labs and Electronic Arts, and somewhere in there he also found time to earn a Masters from the UC Berkeley School of Information. Here's to you Mr. Volz.</p>
