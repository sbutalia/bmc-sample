Welcome to my code samples repository. Here you will find some of my sample AngularJS applications. I use industry best practices while working with AngularJS.

Some of my favorite tools and frameworks along with AngularJS are:
Bower - Javascript dependency management tool used to manage all javascript plugins.
Grunt - Javascript task runner used to minify css/JS and run unit test cases
Bootstrap - Used as backbone for all CSS development.
SASS - Used to simplify CSS development by using reusable blocks of style.
Jasmine - Used to create behavior driven test cases.
